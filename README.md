## Guide to reproducing the results
The following codes are used to reproduce the results in Figure 5-6-7.

The "MatlabLibrary" folder must be added to the path in order to run all other scripts. It contains codes related to network settings and dynamics.

The "Single_Run" folder contains codes to train and test a single network on the Transitive inference task and check it inside.

The "Multiple_Runs" folder contains codes related to results averaged over multiple task realizations and network structures.
